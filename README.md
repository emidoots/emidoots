Hey hihi, it's Emi - I'm building [Mach](https://machengine.org) (the Zig game engine & graphics toolkit), also principal engineer @ [Sourcegraph](https://sourcegraph.com) working on developer tools. Pianist, gardener, and keeper of kittos ([https://meow.army](https://meow.army)) on the side.

[FOSS is in my roots](https://devlog.hexops.com/2021/increasing-my-contribution-to-zig-to-200-a-month/#i-grew-up-playing-linux-games-like-mania-drive) and I dream of creating games and one day being 100% beholden to individuals. :)
